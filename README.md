Project Background (Updated)
============
<p align="justify">
This is an old repo and old project from BIT302 Software Engineering from HELP University.
Project Description:</br>

With nowadays-human population that is greatly (and rapidly) increases, house and land is component that start to become a problem. This is happened due to inequality of economy (common sense) between people. With that said, certain people will have to live in a temporary living place (Apartment, hotels, etc.), while others have their permanent house. The problem that, as population increases, it is starting to be very hard to get a land and build a house, or even rent a temporary living place. Some says because old people have too much house, that makes young people hard to get one (Anderssen, 2018). Some says because either of minimum wages they have that cannot even pay a rent (Anderssen, 2018), (Regan, 2018), or even because there are no more place for rent. Even youths who are looking for boarding house couldn’t even afford to pay rent because of low wages (or inadequate economy), or also because there’s almost no place that is available to rent. (Carney, 2018), (Babulal & Athirah, 2019).</br></br>
This problems turns out also hitting youths in Malaysia. Therefore, Kuala Lumpur City Hall has proposed a scheme to help youths to rent accommodation or boarding houses at affordable prices (Babulal & Athirah, 2019). With this, we want to take the advantage of web-based information system, hoping to help government to accommodate youths in more proper and better way while we can also help youths to get the accommodation in a more efficient, easier, and faster ways.  </br></br>

Students are required to work in a team of TWO (2) only to create the information system for the MHS (Micro Housing System) for DBKL.
